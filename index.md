## Welcome to MM4M365Bot Page

### Name of the project and organization: - MSFT Maturity Model Info Bot Deck for Microsoft Maturity Model

### Description:
The bot will inform people about the Maturity Model for Microsoft 365 (MM4M365) and guide them with questions and examples in order for them to understand what the Maturity Model is, identify the current maturity level for a process, business function or team/department they are interested in, identify the desired future state and give them options / a plan of action to elevate this. 

### Background:
Currently there is a MS partner that is building out a maturity model for Microsoft products based on the CMMI (Capabilities Maturity Model Integration) utilizing MS products. The goal is to use this model for both internal and external Microsoft stakeholders.

### Scope: 
The bot will initially help the user identify what maturity level they currently stand at, identify where they want to go m and provide input on how to get to the next level. Additionally the bot will be expanded to look at specific competency maturity levels and give insights on how to reach the next maturity level along utilizing Microsoft technology.
